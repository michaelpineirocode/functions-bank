    <h1>What does Functions Bank do?</h1>
      <p>Functions Bank is a service for storing, organizing, and sorting
        through snippets of code for easy reuse. Tired of rewriting the same
        code for different assignments and projects? This helps alleviate that.
        By making previous code snippets easy to save and sort through, you no
        longer need to waste time searching through previous project files to 
        find what you are looking for. Never waste time writing the same code
        twice again.
